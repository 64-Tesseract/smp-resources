# Resources for my SMP (V2)

If you're installing the modpack for the first time, copy all 3 folders into your `.minecraft`. Mods under `mods/optional` are ones that people found problematic, but you can move them back into `mods` if you like.  
Alternatively, you can download just the updated mod files under *Releases*, which I package every update.
